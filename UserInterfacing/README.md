This submodule deals with creating a user interface that allows for the user to interact with the different ESP32 scales. It faciitates data retrieval, deletion, scale taring and calibration and statistical view of the data. A mobile app was chosen to facilitate this.

The app has two pages:
- BLE connection and communication page: This page shows automatic connection to the gateway ESP32 when the user is within the correct range. It allows the user to pick which node it wants data from and it shows the live readings of the data being saved to a csv file in SPIFFs. There is the option to save that data to an external file manager, and upon saving that data, the ESP32 memory is cleaned, decreasing chances to it filling up and being overwritten. 
- Statistic page: This gives the overall statistics of the birds in the area. It give the daily average of the number of birds that were weighed, they're average weights, and the standard deviation of their weight. This gives insight on the number of birds in the area and whether it increases or decreases (suggestion of good breeding and migration), shows any alarming weight changes, and could give information on the movement and abundance of their prey.
